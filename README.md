## Context

This game was created for a school project. We had 1 month to develop a game in C++ using a library of our choosing: I chose the SFML library.

Our theme was a picture of a man on a ladder trying to carve out some piece of cloud, but we were entirely free in the realization of our game. 

I worked alone on this project.

## The Game

In this game inspired by space invaders & breakout, the player has to shape clouds by destroying little pieces of cloud. If the player destroys a piece of cloud that was supposed to be there according to the goal cloud, he loses a life. There are 5 different levels with 5 different goal clouds, and with each level the speed increases.
